                <h2>SUN</h2>
                <p>The Sun is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, primarily composed of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements. Its immense gravity dominates the solar system, keeping all planets, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies in orbit around it. The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core, where hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium, releasing vast amounts of light and heat. This energy radiates outwards through the layers of the Sun, reaching the surface, known as the photosphere, and from there, into space. The Sun's surface temperature is about 5,500Â°C, while its core reaches around 15 million degrees Celsius. Surrounding the Sun is its atmosphere, which includes the chromosphere and the outermost layer, the corona, visible during a solar eclipse.</p>
